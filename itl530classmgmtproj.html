<p><strong>Introduction </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The purpose of my Classroom Management Project is to serve as a document which I can look back on to review strategies I can use for classroom management. I believe that classroom management and discipline should help create a safe and optimal learning environment for my students. Moreover, I believe classroom management and discipline would help prepare students for excelling in a professional environment in the future. My goals include to implement strategies that minimize disruptive behavior in students, know how to respond to aggressive behavior in students, and keeping students on task.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rules and Procedures </strong></p>
<p>There is debate on whether it is more effective to have few general rules or a long list of specific rules. I see the value in both and imagine myself establishing both general rules and specific rules. My one important general rule is "be respectful." Students want to be respected and they can agree to get respect by being respectful</p>
<p>Attendance, Absence, and Tardy</p>
<p>I will assign seats for my students and use a software to keep track of absence. When class has started, and the seat with a student assigned is empty, then the student assigned to the seat is absent. I learned this strategy first from a Computer Science teacher, but it is also supported by the Classroom Management Book: &ldquo;When desk are assigned to students and there is consistency in who occupies that seat, taking attendance can be done at a glance,&rdquo; (Wong, 2014, p.79).</p>
<p>I want students entering late to start the activity as soon as possible. I will not use learning time to have a conversation about being late unless is it urgent. The student can leave me a message or talk to me after class. &ldquo;Class is never stopped for a student who is tardy,&rdquo; (Wong, 2014, p.93).</p>
<p>I will post the assignments on my website where all students can see them. This way, even absent students would know what the assignments are. They will turn those assignments into the folder for late assignments. &ldquo;When the absent student returns, there will be no confusion as to where the student can locate the missed assignments,&rdquo; (Wong, 2014, p. 97).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will discuss these rules with my students. To begin, I will tell them why rules in the classroom are necessary. After all, adults in public or professional environments follow regulations. This helps make society safer. Likewise, I want our learning environment to be safe. I may ask my students to create a list of rules they would like to see in the classroom (Sanford, 2017).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My 15 Classroom Rules and Procedures</p>
<ol>
<li>Students should raise their hands and speak when called on.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is to keep order. When multiple students are speaking simultaneously, it is difficult to hear what is said and the volume can make the learning environment anxious.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Students entering the classroom should find their seats and work on the start-of-class activity. During class, transitions should be smooth: quick and quiet. While I&rsquo;m giving a lecture, or facilitating an in-class activity, the student entering the classroom should join in without disrupting. Students may get ready to exit when I&rsquo;ve given the instruction.</li>
</ol>
<p>I believe every second counts in learning. The smoother and less costly the transitions, then the more time and effort is devoted to learning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Students should have required materials and supplies, such as books assigned to them and utensils for taking notes and keeping them organized.</li>
</ol>
<p>The reason for students to have the necessary items ready is so that they can participate in learning.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>When using classroom devices, use with care and return them after use.</li>
</ol>
<p>In a Computer Science class, computers in the classroom are expected. Students are free to either bring their own devices or use the classroom devices. The classroom devices are shared learning tools. Making the devices unusable would be unfair to others who may want to use them.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>When students need to use the restroom, they will raise a hand with two fingers, then I will respond by giving thumbs up. At this signal, the student is free to leave the classroom, but is expected to return in a reasonable time frame.</li>
</ol>
<p>The reason for this hand gesture is efficiency. This way, students do not have to ask for permission while competing with students asking questions related to the content.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>During a lecture or in-class activity, students should not be talking about topics unrelated to class. Talks productive to learning should be at a reasonable volume.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is because I want the learning environment geared towards learning. When students are talking off topic, they are not focused on the lecture or class activity. However, I encourage students to talk to one another if it helps with their learning. English Learners may benefit greatly from a friend explaining terms to them. I just ask the talk to be at a reasonable volume so it doesn&rsquo;t distract other students too much.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Only water is allowed in my class.</li>
</ol>
<p>Whether a snack or a full meal, the students eating have given their attention to their food and away from the class activity. Moreover, the smells of the food and the sounds of students eating will likely distract the rest of the students. Furthermore, bringing food into the classroom increases the likelihood of creating a mess, making the learning environment unpleasant.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>Students should not bring distracting items such as video games in class.</li>
</ol>
<p>The items they bring should help make the learning environment productive, not dangerous. Before leaving class, students should collect their personal items and not leave them in the classroom. I myself will refrain from brining distracting items into the classroom.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>Students should follow my directions.</li>
</ol>
<p>The directions I give in class serve to optimize students&rsquo; learning, so they should attend to directions not simply because I am their teacher, but because it is for their learning. There may be exceptions. If students are not able to follow some directions without experiencing great anxiety due to a medical or special need, then they exempt. I will do my best to accommodate should the need arises. However, I will be very mindful in giving directions that every student can reasonably follow.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>Students should address me as Mr. Huang and use courteous verbal and body language.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is because I want to establish effective teacher-student relationships with my students. If students see me as a friend, they may not respect me as a teacher and this hurts the students&rsquo; learning.</p>
<ol start="11">
<li>Be present in class.</li>
</ol>
<p>Class time is devoted to learning and absences mean missing out on learning. I understand if students have a medical or personal reason to be absent. In these cases, they should notify me in advance if possible.</p>
<ol start="12">
<li>Complete assignments on time.</li>
</ol>
<p>Their assignments are used to help me track their learning progress and lets me know if they need extra help on the subject. A missing assignment means a missing grade. There are exceptions. If students have a medical reason or have major personal commitments, then they may request an extension for the assignment. They should notify me in advance if possible.</p>
<ol start="13">
<li>Treat members of the learning community with respect.</li>
</ol>
<p>A respectful atmosphere is conducive to learning.</p>
<ol start="14">
<li>No harassment.</li>
</ol>
<p>I want the learning environment to be safe. I will meet with students who speak unkind words to their peers. I will tell them how harmful their behavior is and ask them to apologize. The message I want to give is: harassment is not okay. If the students&rsquo; harassment in class is extreme or frequent, then I will take further disciplinary action: bringing the issue to parents or other school faculty.</p>
<ol start="15">
<li>Students should notify me of health issues that may interfere with class.</li>
</ol>
<p>This way, I can accommodate them more effectively and think of ways to minimize potential disruption. This also helps me know that the medication they bring is safe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will discuss these rules with my students. To begin, I will tell them why rules in the classroom are necessary. After all, adults in public or professional environments follow regulations. This helps make society safer. Likewise, I want our learning environment to be safe. I may ask my students to create a list of rules they would like to see in the classroom (Sanford, 2017).</p>
<p>Proactive Classroom Management</p>
<p>The proactive classroom management strategy is a popular strategy recommended by multiple teaching resources. Using this strategy means I will structure my class in a way that minimizes misbehavior. I will have tasks for students with clear instructions, so students will have tasks to do and know how to do it (Sanford, 2017). Thus, as a general rule, students should always be involved in the learning activity.</p>
<p><strong>Rewards </strong></p>
<p>I believe the IRIS module &ldquo;Addressing Disruptive and Noncompliant Behavior (Part 2) Behavioral Interventions&rdquo; would be an appropriate resource for this section. This module gave a number of strategies and emphasized on differential reinforcement. The key is: I can be mindful of the goals I give my students and reward them appropriately when they progress towards their goals. I also must be careful to not reward inappropriate behavior.</p>
<p>Positive reinforcements must be age-appropriate to have the desired effect. I think rewarding stars or good behavior points would be unfitting for 6-12 students, the age range I plan on teaching. In my observation, students seem to have less respect for teachers who treat them like young children and have more respect for teachers who treat them like adults. I want to reward my students respectfully so that the rewards will have the effect I want.</p>
<p>Praise, when utilized properly, may be the most effective award. I cringe when I hear teachers say &ldquo;good kid&rdquo; to their high school students. Phrases commonly used as passive aggressive remarks or nicknames for pets cannot be effective praises in my opinion. I can imagine myself saying to the class &ldquo;thank you for being professional.&rdquo; I may also give more specific praises on tasks such as &ldquo;excellent job on coding this function&rdquo; or &ldquo;your approach to solving this coding challenge is excellent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I think another effective reward for students is giving them free time. This is a reward I would only give to students who have met certain criteria. If students have consistently behaved professionally in class, completed all in-class tasks and bonus tasks, and proved that they have mastered the learning objectives by excelling in assessments, I may reward them by allowing them to leave class early.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I plan on teaching Computer Science and Mathematics. If the school allowed me enough flexibility, I can easily teach my computer science class in an intrinsically rewarding way. This will be explored further in the Engagement and Motivation section.</p>
<p><strong>Consequences </strong></p>
<p>There must be plans for corrective measures. I plan to implement logical consequences for student actions. I will guide my students to use reason to identify and assess their actions in the classroom. They need to understand that the actions they take have consequences. My implementations of consequences are not simple punishments but meant to promote student responsibility. When students arrive late to class for the first or second time, I will work with them to create solutions that help them get to class on time. Moreover, consequences I implement will be logical and related to the behavior. For example, the consequence for students who arrive to class late three times is that they have to make up for what they missed in class (Sanford, 2017).</p>
<p>Multiple teachers I have talked to give me this advice: have honest conversations with students. Before I get help from parents or other faculties, I need to do my part first. Taking time to talk to students is a logical and practical early consequence. Through this, I have the opportunity to learn why they have engaged in noncompliant behavior. I may also learn how I can better support them. If needed, I may have students spend some time outside the classroom. I got this advice from other teachers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Intervention and Support Strategies </strong></p>
<p>Utilizing a proactive strategy with defined rules and procedures should minimize aggressively disruptive behavior in students. However, I still need to have plans on how to handle challenging encounters should they arise. Fortunately, I have learned a lot from various resources.</p>
<p>The lessons I learned from the IRIS module &ldquo;Addressing Disruptive and Noncompliant Behavior (Part 1) Understanding the Acting-Out Cycle&rdquo; would be especially helpful here. This module taught me that students go through stages when it comes to acting out. I should: aim to recognize early signs before they escalate; try to keep students in the calm phase; take steps to prevent students from triggers; identifying signs of agitation in students and responding appropriately; remember to stay patient and calm if encountering a student in the acceleration phase; ensure that students in the classroom are not getting hurt if a student is in the peak phase and implement school policy if appropriate; communicate effectively with students in the de-escalation and recovery phases, learn what triggered the students and come up with a prevention plan. In short, I should identify the stage and apply the approach appropriate for the stage. The best I can do is recognize signs early and address them before they escalate.</p>
<p>The Classroom Management Book, in the chapter &ldquo;The Angry Student&rdquo;, pages 232 to 235, suggests to: give students time to calm down; be professional; communicate effectively with the students; and use open body language (Wong, 2014).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Engagement and Motivation</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have ways to maintain student engagement and motivation, especially when teaching Computer Science. First, I can start by talking about technology. Technology is fun and relevant. Computer software, websites, mobile applications, and video games are all built from computer programming, the skill I will be teaching. My students will be learning the skills professionals use to create exciting technology. Second, I can talk about careers. Software developers or computer engineers are the trendy, popular and high paying careers. Career minded students will be glad to know that they are having a head-start in their potential software career by learning computer science in high school. The projects they build in my class will be impressive to employers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, students can be proud of themselves for tackling computer science, a subject many adults find challenging to learn. In the Rewards section, I said I can teach my computer science class in an intrinsically rewarding way. I can make my class engaging by having my students work on projects that are exciting to them. They can build websites related to their interests, or program games. I will frame coding challenges as games to beat. If I am teaching a Mathematics class, I can still frame solving math exercises as games to beat in a similar way. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Social and Emotional Skills </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have some social and emotional skills and self-regulating strategies I can use to teach to create a harmonious, productive learning community. Many teachers and teaching resources would agree that, to help students develop socially and emotionally, I need to set a good example. On setting a good social skills example, the Classroom Management Book, in pages 53 to 56, introduces the strategy of greeting students every day (Wong, 2014). I will use this strategy. Before my class starts, I will stand outside my classroom and greet my students entering the classroom. Some argue that social skills is more complex than courtesy, but I think courtesy sets a strong foundation. On setting a good emotional skills example, even when students are aggressive in their body language or tone, I must remind myself to be professional, and be calm. My calm body language and tone would give students a sense of safety.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As someone on the autism spectrum, I understand how important learning social and emotional skills is. That said, I have no training, experience, or expertise in teaching advanced social and emotional skills. If needed, I will seek help from faculties who have more expertise in this area than I do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think I may have some unique advantages. Despite not being a special education teacher, I may be able to relate and mentor students on the spectrum in ways neurotypical faculties cannot.</p>
<p><strong>Culturally Responsive Teaching </strong></p>
<p>I have some culturally responsive classroom management strategies. The IRIS Modules have touched on culture as a factor in student behavior. The IRIS module Classroom Management (Part 1): Learning the Components of a Comprehensive Behavior Management Plan, in page 2, discusses cultural influences on behavior. The strategy here is for me to be mindful of those cultural influences. For example, avoiding eye contact might be commonly deemed disrespectful, but may be regarded as respectful in a different culture. This awareness helps me to avoid misunderstandings. Moreover, I lived my childhood and had my K12 education in Taiwan, so I think I bring cultural diversity as a teacher. When it is relevant to the content area, I may briefly discuss culture. For example, I may talk about how culture plays a role in the professional environment, specifically in tech.</p>
<p><strong>Summary and Reflection </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To summarize, the purpose of this Classroom Management Project is to help me work as a more effective classroom manager, and thus help give my students a more optimal learning environment. The project went over: how I will establish rules and procedures and teach them to the class; what age-appropriate rewards I will use; what consequences I will use for inappropriate behaviors; my intervention and support strategies; how I will maintain student engagement and motivation; the social and emotional skills and self-regulating strategies I will teach; and my culturally responsive classroom management strategies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Working on this classroom management project made me think about TPE 2: Creating and Maintaining Effective Environments for Student Learning of the California Teaching Performance Expectations. I find this project most relevant to TPE 2.6: &ldquo;Establish and maintain clear expectations for positive classroom behavior and for student-to-student and student-to- teacher interactions by communicating classroom routines, procedures, and norms to students and families.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even before I worked on this assignment, I have always believed that effective classroom management plays a significant role in effective teaching. However, the prospect of managing a classroom is daunting to me. My experience in working on this project has helped in taking steps to alleviate my fears. A key is planning, and this project is a foundation to my ongoing plan. Furthermore, I have gained knowledge in the process of studying the resources I used for this project. The Classroom Management Book have taught me strategies on making rules and procedures as well as the strategy of greeting students every day. The IRIS module on the Acting-Out Cycle taught me valuable knowledge on how to identify and intervene disruptive behavior in students.</p>
